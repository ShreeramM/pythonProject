#   = operator means assigning value to a variable
# variablename = variable value
# == operator - used for comparison of two numbers
# a= 10,b = 20 a == b it will return False
# ** Operator is used for exponential purpose i.e x **2 x =2 so result is 4
# ^ Operator is Bitwise Operator
a = 10
b=20
result = a == b
print(result)

x = 2**3 #exponential /power operator
print(x)

#^ - Bitwsie Xor operator
a = True
b = False
print(a ^ b)#True
